<div class="pure-g">

        <div id="intro">
                <p><br/>The bushfires that occured during the summer of 2019-2020 are one of the worst that the country has experienced. 
                    The 2019-20 bushfire season was intense due to a range of factors that include; dry conditions, a lack of soil moisture and dry lightning strikes.
                    All parts of the country were impacted by these bushfires, however, New South Wales and Victoria suffered the most. New South Wales had at least one fire
                    running from July 2019 to March 2020, when the last fire was put out. Efforts of the CFA and other volunteer firefighters are to be remembered from the time.
                    This visualisation explores some causes and impacts of the 2019-20 bushfire season.

            <p><br/><br/><br/>The 2019-20 fires are estimated to have burned 24.3 million hectares of land in Australia. The map on the left provides a representation
                of the impacted regions, and the percentage of land burned in each LGA. The most affected LGA was Eurobodalla in New South Wales, where 80.8% 
                of the land was burned. Majority of the fires that occured were around the border of Victoria and New South Wales. Other highly impacted LGAs
                include Hawkesbury, Shoalhaven and East Gippsland. Dry lightning strikes in East Gippsland caused some fires to start, which then burned for months.

        <h2>Impact of weather conditions on bushfires</h2>
        <div id="weather_explanation">
            <p> The climate conditions during 2019 increased the severity of the 2019-20 bushfires. Comparing temperature changes to 1961-90 averages, the 2019 
                temperature increase is the highest on record. It was 1.52Â°C higher than the average. The nation also experienced several heatwaves over the summer. 
                <br/><br/>In 2019, Australia had an annual rainfall of 228.4mm. The heat and low rainfall earned 2019 the title of Australia's driest year on record.
                These conditions made the bushfires difficult to control, causing them to burn for longer.

            <p>
                Data shows that there is a clear link between increased bushfire activity and people seeking assistance for their health.
                The most common reasons for an emergency department visit during bushfire season are asthma, breathing abnormalities, burns, chest pain and respiratory conditions.
                The crude rate of emergency deparment visits for these health conditions has been compared in the bar chart below. The crude rate of the 2019-20 bushfire
                season has been compared with the 2018-19 season, to accurately show the impacts of the 2019-20 season.
                Respiratory conditions have the highest crude rate, which is likely to be caused by bushfire smoke, and poor air quality.

                Overall, weather conditions played a large role in the cause of the 2019-20 bushfires. The health impacts caused by the 2019-20 bushfires were clearly significant.
                Despite the negative impacts, hopefully the 2019-20 bushfire season taught the nation how to be bushfire safe, and bushfire ready for any future ones to come.
